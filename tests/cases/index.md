You know, as an engineer it's kinda natural to think _"note-taking is useless"_, since engineering requires deep understanding of applications, creativity and experience. but at some point in my under-grad this belief hit me. [[what good is learning if you don't remember it]]?

I've always treated _understanding_ as a something sacred. I've always tried to solve a problem multiple times before revealing the answer. I've even had a fight with my high-school administration about a teacher who believed in [[rote learning]] (he taught physics).

honestly with the rise of [[LLM]]s I doubt my belief more often.
